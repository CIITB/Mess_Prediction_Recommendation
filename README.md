# **Smart Mess Menu Recommender**

## **Problem Statement**

This project aims to build a **Smart Mess Menu Recommender** system that helps students:  
1. Predict how likely people are to eat in the mess based on the dayâ€™s menu.  
2. Recommend whether to eat at the mess or skip it.  
3. Optionally, suggest better alternatives during low predicted attendance.

---

## **Approach**

Since the mess menu is fixed and rotates weekly, I generated a synthetic dataset based on three main features:
- **Day** (Monday to Sunday)
- **Meal** (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner)
- **Menu Items** (18 fixed dishes, repeated across different days/meals)

The target variable was **Attendance** (number of students likely to eat).

### **Feature Encoding**
- `Day`: encoded as ordinal numbers (0â€“6 for Monâ€“Sun)  
- `Meal`: encoded as categorical labels  
- `Menu Items`: encoded as categorical values (no OOV since menu is fixed)

### **Modeling**
- Used **Random Forest Regressor**, an ensemble learning method that handles non-linear relationships and categorical data effectively.
- Trained the model to predict attendance based on the day, meal type, and menu item.

### **Recommender System Logic**
- Once the predicted attendance (`y_pred`) is computed:
  - If `y_pred < 90`, the system recommends skipping the meal.
  - To suggest alternatives, the system:
    - Looks into the dataset to find all menus served for the same meal type across all days.
    - Calculates the mean attendance for each menu.
    - Recommends the top 3 menus based on popularity (attendance).
  - If `y_pred â‰¥ 90`, the meal is recommended as **worth eating**.

## **Setup Instructions**

To run the Smart Mess Menu Predictor & Recommender, follow these steps:

1. Download & Unzip the folder named `mess_predictor_and_recommender`.
2. It contains:
   - `Dataset (mess_data.csv)`
   - `Dataset generation script`
   - `Model training & prediction code`
   - A separate `model.api` folder for the API
3. Open the model training code and update the dataset path to match your local directory structure.
4. Run this script:
   - It will **train the model** using Random Forest Regressor.
   - Generate a serialized `model.pkl` file.
5. Navigate to the `model.api/` folder.
6. Replace the placeholder `model.pkl` with the newly generated one from the previous step.
7. Open the folder in VS Code (or any IDE).
8. Run the API:
   - In the terminal, execute: `python app.py`
9. If needed, adjust the library versions in `requirements.txt` to match your system.
10. Once the server starts, it will generate a local link.
11. Open the link in your browser.
12. Select the **Day**, **Meal**, and **Menu Item**.
13. It will:
    - Predict expected attendance.
    - Recommend whether to eat or skip.
    - Suggest better menu options.

## **Assumptions Made**

1. The mess menu remains unchanged and rotates on a fixed weekly basis.  
2. The maximum number of students that can eat in the mess is assumed to be **150**.  
3. A threshold of **90** is used to decide whether to recommend the meal.  
4. Only **18 distinct menu items** are included in the dataset.  
5. While the system is designed primarily for students to make dining decisions, it can also be beneficial for mess workers and administration:
   - Reducing food waste  
   - Planning meal preparations efficiently
